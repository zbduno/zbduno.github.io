			<p class="p2"> Favorite CMSC subject so far </p>
			<p> Among all the CMSC subjects I took, I enjoyed CMSC 22 the most. Perhaps it's because I liked object oriented programming. </p>
			<p class="p2"> Favorite GE Subject so far </p>
			<p> I really liked STS because the professor always made things interesting with tasks that are enjoyable yet deeply connected to our topics. </p>
			<p class="p2"> Favorite programming language so far </p>
			<p> Java! I think that one of the reasons I loved CMSC 22 the most is because I really enjoyed coding with Java.
			<p class="p2"> Favorite food </p>
			<p> I love carbonara! Fun fact: it was the first dish I learned to cook besides rice and fried stuff. </p>
